### STRIPE CHECKOUT

---

This looks like a pre-built solution.   See the following cover page:

https://stripe.com/gb/payments/checkout

Then the following link:

- https://checkout.stripe.dev

- Honestly, I found this demonstration to be ver good compared to paypal.   It has a single payment checkout example and a recurring payment example.   It looks like these payment systems are hosted on an external website, so that is a downside and the demo's are a bit limited in the colours and not having the ability to customize the navbar, but it may be possible to get around this.   When you look at the page it also brings up sample card numbers to test success, failure etc.   It offers apple pay or google pay depending on what device you are using.   The docs are in the following location:


### Stripe Elements

---

This allows you to design your own payments form on your own website.   You can build it yourself, or contact them and they could build it for you.

There is an example page located here:

> https://stripe.dev/elements-examples/

This is a link to the docs:

> https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js

### API

---

There is documentation on the API here:

> https://stripe.com/docs/api

### PYTHON

---

This is really interesting, there is a link to a sample Python library on github:

> https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python

However if you look at the readme docs, you can also see a link to a set of video's on how to use stripe as a developer:

### STRIPE BILLING

---

This looks interesting:

> https://stripe.com/au/billing

It looks like a user system where you can create a billing plan.

It looks like you can do one time payments and recurring billing plans and it looks like it might be easy to maintain.

It says that it is easy to integrate with existing websites, that you can customize bills with your own logo and that it has webhooks to notify other systems of important lifecycle events.

There is information on invoices here:

> https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/overview

Billing:

> https://stripe.com/docs/billing

Testing card numbers etc:

> https://stripe.com/docs/testing

This has github examples:

### SUMMARY

---

I decided to start off with a very basic checkout based solution and then see what happens.
